            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>8 ounces linguine</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
                    <li>3 teaspoons freshly-squeezed lemon juice</li>
                    <li>2/3 cup heavy cream</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 tablespoon cajun seasoning</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>1/2 dried italian seasoning</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                    <li>freshly grated black pepper</li>
                    <li>chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add linguine and cook al dente according to package directions, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup pasta water.</li>
                    <li> Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic, and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Pour in white wine and lemon juice, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes.</li>
                    <li>In a small bowl, whisk cream, Cajun seasoning, flour, and Italian seasoning together until smooth. Gradually add to the skillet, whisking constantly until well incorporated, about 1 minute. Stir in Parmesan and sun-dried tomatoes, stirring until slightly thickened, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add linguine, and toss until well coated. If a bit thick, add pasta water a teaspoon at a time to reach your desired consistency. Season with black pepper, garnish with parsley or green onions, and serve.</li> 
                </ol>
